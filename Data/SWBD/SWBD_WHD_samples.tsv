use	['juːs' 'juːz']	juz	'juːz	But I just do n't find the time that I can use it
use	['juːs' 'juːz']	jus	'juːz	If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass

use	['juːs' 'juːz']	juz	'juːz	And then all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an american express card and and pay it off every month

use	['juːs' 'juːz']	juz	'juːz	And you never really use them
use	['juːs' 'juːz']	juz	'juːz	Course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they do n't use
use	['juːs' 'juːz']	juz	'juːz	But I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good
use	['juːs' 'juːz']	juz	'juːz	Do you use that facility a lot

wind	['wɪnd' 'waɪnd']	waɪnd	'waɪnd	Because people that uh do n't make very much money wind up spending it all
wind	['wɪnd' 'waɪnd']	waɪnd	'waɪnd	And they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in mesquite who was out in six months
wind	['wɪnd' 'waɪnd']	wɪnd	'waɪnd	And so I wind up going out camping with uh a bunch of boys at one time
